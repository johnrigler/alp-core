alp-core 
===========

What is ALP (core)?
-------------------

[ALP](https://ledger.church/alp) is a hard form of Bitcoin-SV.  It is intended to be used as a proof-of-work 
blockchain database. I will compile and share versions of ALP for Ubuntu initially, and encourage others to 
do the same for other environments.

Another element of ALP exists in a separate repository which is a bash functional environment which I have developed
over the years. It is not required to use this product.

ALP will allow you to generate your own genesis block and customize the inner working of your blockchain to a great
degree, probably in the initial few blocks of operation. It is suitable for public, private, or hybrid operations.
